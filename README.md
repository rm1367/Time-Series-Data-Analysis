<h1>Time-Series Analysis: Stock Data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project is designed to analyze and visualize time-series data from a CSV file, specifically focusing on stock prices within a user-defined date range. The program takes multiple command-line arguments, including the file name, index column, date range, and data columns to be analyzed. It reads the dataset using pandas, extracts the relevant data based on user-specified parameters, and then transposes the selected columns for better visualization. The processed data is plotted using matplotlib, providing a clear representation of stock price trends over time. This project is significant as it enables efficient financial data analysis, allowing users to quickly assess stock performance trends and gain insights into market behavior.

*Note: The "z" string showing in the date in the charts below was part of a challenge set forth to include data entry errors in dates when plotting.
